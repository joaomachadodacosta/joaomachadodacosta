# Hey! 💥 🤙🏻

I am **Junior FullStack Developer** looking to solve real problems.  

I have an eagle eye for **design** with a special aptitude to **communicate** effectively and in an appealing way. Now I have been completely intoxicated by code and since then I have not been able to leave IT. **I am addicted!** 

My goal is to add value by combining my knowledge with programming.
